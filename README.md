# Grocceries
## About the Project
This was a semester long project for CS 4080: Software Engineering at Cal Poly Pomona.

Our groups name was Grocceries(g-rock-ries). The purpose of the project was to make
an online ordering service for groceries. Our group implemented a full stack of PostgreSQL,
Django, CSS, bootstrap, JS, and HTML. We also used paypal and google map API's.
